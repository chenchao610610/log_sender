Simply tails the file and send it to remote syslog server.

 * can handle if the file is rotated (via checking inode id)
 * every file has its own tailer thread

Usage:
 $ ./start.sh

Configuration example:

config.ini
--- CUT ---
[files]
/var/log/apache2/access.log = true
/var/log/syslog = true

[main]
syslog_server = 1.1.1.1
--- CUT ---
