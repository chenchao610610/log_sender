Simply tails the file and send it to remote syslog server.

 * can handle if the file is rotated (via checking inode id)
 * every file has its own tailer thread

Usage:
 $ ./start.sh

Configuration example:

config.json
--- CUT ---
{
    "syslog_server" : "1.1.1.1",
    "files": [
        {"name":"access_log","filepath" : "/var/log/apache2/access.log"},
        {"name":"syslog","filepath" : "/var/log/syslog.log"},
    ]
}
--- CUT ---
